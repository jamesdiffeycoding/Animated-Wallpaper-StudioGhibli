# Multimedia Studio Ghibli

This simple site showcases some of Studio Ghibli's best work. I used building it to learn about multimedia in HTML.

## Functionality

- display video in HTML using <video> element, rendered to full screen with audio playing by default
- add thematic gif to background of button, showing on hover
- add transitions on page load and as video starts

## Things I practiced / learned

- Through this project I learned about the <video> element
  --- its inbuilt properties (e.g. controls, muted, autoplay)
  --- browser behaviours (e.g. autoplay is possible but only muted, except with user interaction)
- How to use Refs in React to modify HTML
