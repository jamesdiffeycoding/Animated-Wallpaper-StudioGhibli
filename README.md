# Multimedia Studio Ghibli

This simple site showcases some of Studio Ghibli's best work. 

I found making it helped me learn about media elements in web development - videos (and their attributes), GIFs, opacity transitions,the useRef hook for DOM adjustments, and browser specific policies (such as around autoplaying videos muted and how to workaround it). 

## Tasks completed

- display video in HTML using the video element, rendered to full screen with audio playing by default ✔️
- add thematic gif to background of button, showing on hover ✔️
- add transitions on page load and as video starts ✔️
- add Ghibli favicon and fonts ✔️
- show video controls and download options on-click ✔️
- compress video by 50% ✔️
